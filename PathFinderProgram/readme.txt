Program that allows the user to open a map (a background image) and define locations on it by clicking. The user can also add connections between these locations. The program can then be used to find a route between two user-selected locations.

Each location has a name (e.g., “Kista”, “New York”, “Andromeda Galaxy”) and can be connected to other locations. Each connection has a name (e.g., “Bus 514”, “Flight”, “Teleportation”) and a travel time. The connection’s name and time do not need to be displayed on the map.

The user can define new locations by clicking a “New place” button and then selecting a point on the map. Existing locations can be selected by clicking on them, which changes their color.

To create a connection, the user selects two locations by clicking on them. Once selected, they can define a connection between these locations, view or edit the connection’s details, or print the route between the two locations.
